# AirPods Pro Animation

A recreation of Apple's AirPods Pro scroll-based animation using GSAP and HTML Canvas. This project demonstrates how to create smooth, scroll-triggered animations with image sequences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `airpods.html` in your browser

## üéØ How it works

The animation uses a sequence of 65 frames from Apple's website. As you scroll:

- The AirPods rotate smoothly through the frame sequence
- GSAP's ScrollTrigger handles the scroll-based animation timing
- Canvas renders each frame based on scroll position
