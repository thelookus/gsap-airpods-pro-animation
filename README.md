A recreation of Apple's AirPods Pro scroll-based animation using GSAP and HTML Canvas. This project demonstrates how to create smooth, scroll-triggered animations with image sequences.

## 🚀 Technologies

- HTML5 Canvas
- GSAP 3.13.0
  - ScrollTrigger Plugin
  - SplitText Plugin
- Vanilla JavaScript

## ✨ Features

- Scroll-based animation control
- Smooth frame transitions
- Responsive design
- Image sequence animation
- Text fade and scale effects

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `airpods.html` in your browser
3. No build process required!

## 🎯 How it works

The animation uses a sequence of 65 frames from Apple's website. As you scroll:
- The title text fades out and scales up
- The AirPods rotate smoothly through the frame sequence
- GSAP's ScrollTrigger handles the scroll-based animation timing
- Canvas renders each frame based on scroll position
